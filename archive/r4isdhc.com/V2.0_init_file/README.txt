This is the `_DS_MENU.DAT` binary for V2.0 carts from r4isdhc.com.

This cart require the file to be present on SD card root to start up, as a part of the cart's firmware is stored on this file. Without it, the cart will boot a white screen no matter what other files are on the SD.

When this file is present on the SD card root, it will behave the same as a regular DEMON hardware cart.
