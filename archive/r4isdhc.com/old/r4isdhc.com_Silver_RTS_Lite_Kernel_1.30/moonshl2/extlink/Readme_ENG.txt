You can set MoonShell2 to open filename extensions using external applications.
Even if you don't use this Extended Link function, don't delete this folder.

The NDS filename defines what file it will open.
For example, if you copy the file "ipk.nds" into this folder, if you open an IPK file it will automatically load "ipk.nds."  
If you put "mp3.nds" or "jpg.nds" into this folder, the Extended Link function will take priority over the MoonShell's built-in internal player/viewer.

If you try to set an incompatible file for the Extended Link function, the file will just open normally.
For example, if you rename "ReinMoon.nds" to "sav.nds" and put it in this folder, whenever you open a .sav file it will simply load ReinMoon, but not the save.

It's easy to create Extended Link-compatible files (I made it as simple as possible).
Please refer to "moonshl2_extlink_for_developer.txt" (unavailable) for details.
It also describes how to exit homebrew and go back to MoonShell2 (this is a little complicated).
