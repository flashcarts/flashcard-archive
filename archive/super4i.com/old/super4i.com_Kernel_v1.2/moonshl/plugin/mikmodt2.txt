
ModPlug-XMMS and libmodplug are now in the public domain.

Modplug Plugin for XMMS v2.0 / libmodplug v0.7
 Based on the ModPlug sound engine by Olivier Lapicque <olivierl@jps.net>
 XMMS plugin by Kenton Varda <temporal@gauge3d.org>
 Placed in the public domain in October, 2001

Olivier Lapicque, author of Modplug, which is arguably the best quality
MOD-playing software available, has placed his sound rendering code in the
public domain.  This library and plugin is based on that code.

For more information on libmodplug, the library for decoding mod-like music
formats, see libmodplug/README.

NOTE TO FELLOW OPEN SOURCE PROGRAMMERS:
  I (Kenton Varda) no longer have the time or desire to maintain this library.
  If anyone would like to take over for me, please e-mail me at
  <temporal@gauge3d.org>.  Thanks.
